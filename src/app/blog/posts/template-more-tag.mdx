This content is before the [more tag](https://en.support.wordpress.com/splitting-content/more-tag/ "The More Tag").

Right after this sentence should be a "continue reading" button of some sort on list pages of themes that show full content. It won't show on single pages or on themes showing excerpts.

<!--more-->

And this content is after the more tag. (which should be the anchor link for when the button is clicked)
