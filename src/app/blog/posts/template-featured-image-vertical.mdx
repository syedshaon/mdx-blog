This post should display a [featured image](https://en.support.wordpress.com/featured-images/#setting-a-featured-image "Featured Images"), if the theme [supports it](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Thumbnails "Post Thumbnails").

Non-square images can provide some unique styling issues.

This post tests a vertical featured image.
