## Title should not overflow the content area

A few things to check for:

- Non-breaking text in the title, content, and comments should have no adverse effects on layout or functionality.
- Check the browser window / tab title.
- If you are a plugin or widget developer, check that this text does not break anything.

The following CSS properties will help you support non-breaking text.

```
-ms-word-wrap: break-word;
word-wrap: break-word;
```
